          The tropical islands of Antigua and Barbuda are located in the heart of the Caribbean about a
          thousand miles to the east of Jamaica and half that distance from Trinidad on the coast of South
          America. We are at 17- N latitude, about the same as the Cape Verde Islands and Bombay and 61- W
          longitude.

          The island of Antigua was born out of the sea by a volcano about 30 million years ago. A young
          island in geologic time. On the northern flank of this volcano, reefs were formed, hence the greater
          part of Antigua is low lying and is composed of limestone rock.

          The highest point of Antigua is 1,319 ft in the south-west and is called Boggy Peak, but the
          limestone Highlands of Barbuda rise to only 125 ft. The area of Antigua is 108 square miles, while
          Barbuda is 62 square miles. The population of the former is approaching 80,000, but the latter is
          relatively unpopulated at 1,300. Days and nights are refreshingly cooled by the gentle trade winds.

          Barbuda became separated from Antigua by about 28 miles, when the sea-levels of the world rose
          considerably at about 10,000 BC. Today parts of Barbuda are geologically flooded to form interesting
          lagoons. Here may be seen the largest breeding and nesting colony of the Magnificent Frigate Bird in
          the world. Barbuda supports a tremendous diversity of native habitats, as yet unthreatened by
          development. Reef-fringed Barbuda may be one of the best kept ecological secrets in the West Indies.
          Her rugged scenery, beautiful beaches, (one at least 12 miles long), lagoons and abundant wildlife
          may be a resource as valuable as its fisheries.

        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;" class="float-left "> Legend has it, that when Columbus was
          near Redonda on November 11th 1493, he sighted the island and named it ‘Santa Maria de la Antigua’,
          supposedly after a chapel dedicated to a famous miracle-working virgin in Seville Cathedral, Spain.
          Antigua means ‘ancient’ in Spanish. Despite giving it a name, Columbus never actually landed on the
          island.

          An alternative explanation comes from a writer of 1756, a sailor of HMS Blandford at the Antigua
          Navy Yard, who claimed the name Antigua was given by Columbus as ‘anti-aguo’, signifying no water or
          an enemy to water. The truth has sadly been lost to time.
          The native Carib name of Waladli (which has since been changed to Wadadli by modern Antiguans), was
          found in Father Breton’s 17th century French dictionary together with the names of other Caribbean
          islands (Breton 1665:416). The name is very close to the Amerindian word for oil, which was ‘wadli’
          (Breton 1665:403). The Dominican Caribs had few reefs on which to collect natural resources, whereas
          Antigua had many, so these prehistoric peoples may have come to Antigua to collect shark and other
          oils found in a reef environment. These oils would have been used for lighting and medicinal
          purposes.

          According to Ferdinand Columbus, the son of Christopher, the earlier name for Antigua used by other
          Arawakan-speaking peoples was Yarumaqui. The meaning may be derived from the Yaruma, a plant from
          which canoes and rafts were made, and ‘qui’, an island. This plant no longer grows on Antigua but is
          common on the surrounding wetter islands.
